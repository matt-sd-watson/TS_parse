# TS_parse
Python scripts dedicated to automated parsing of Agilent TapeStation 2200 run reports for input into a LIMS system. Python scripts 
have been written for both samples going into NGS library prep as well as the final library that is compatible with an NGS 
sequencing platform such as Illumina sequencing. Pythons cripts have been written to generate a final CSV file that is compatible 
with auto-populating a customized LIMS system created through MISO http://tgac.github.io/miso-lims/
