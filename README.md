Python scripts dedicated to automated parsing of Agilent TapeStation 2200 run reports for input into a LIMS system. Scripts 
have been written for both RNA samples going into NGS library prep as well as final DNA/RNA libraries that are compatible with an NGS 
sequencing platform such as Illumina. The final CSV file output is compatible with auto-populating a customized LIMS system created through MISO by members of the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research (OICR): http://tgac.github.io/miso-lims/
